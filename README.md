# JavaScriptmas - 2020
This is all of the projects I have completed for the 2020 JavaScriptmas advent calendar from Scrimba.

I had a lot of fun with this coding advent calendar! I have tried to do others in the past, but they always ended up being way too hard. I think this JavaScriptmas advent from Scrimba was perfect. It was a lot of fun and I had a lot of fun doing it. I never thought any of the challenges were so hard either that I just wanted to give up on them. I particularly enjoyed the ones for Day 8 (Roll the Dice), Day 15 (JavaScript Carousel), and Day 24 (Test Your Agility). I thought making these little apps work was a lot of fun. 

Doing these challenges I also got to use some JavaScrip features I don't always get to use. `Set()` and `Math.abs()` for example. It's nice to have a challenge like this where you can ue some of the tools in JavaScript that you do not normally get to use.

## Day 5 | Reverse a String 
- Exactly how it sounds, reverse a given string!
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/learn/adventcalendar/note-at-0-43-co3e843879d4ebf35c7485583)

## Day 6 | Sort by Length 
- Sort the array by the length of each array element from smallest to largest.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/learn/adventcalendar/note-at-0-46-coa7c4334b5e5eb6543bd33ef)

## Day 7 | Count Vowel Consonant

## Day 8 | Roll the Dice 
- Create an app that rolls a dice for you!
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co3a743adbc7ed0b01b28f9e0)

## Day 9 | Sum Off Fibonacci Numbers 
- Add up all the fibonacci numbers until a given number is reached or exceeded.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co7644dcebcf935939a62c2a2)

## Day 10 | Adjacent Element Products 
- Find the largest product by multiplying the 2 adjacent numbers in an array.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co75348559f896a45696a4920)

## Day 11 | Avoid the Obstacles 
- This one was complicated. Given an array of numbers, what is the smallest number you can use where if you keep adding the number by itself, you will never reach the numbers in the array.
  - For example `let arr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11]` the answer would be `3`. You could keep adding 3 and never hit one of the "obstacles" in the array. 3, 6, or 9 are not in the obstacle array.

- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co2f8429d9889df1875934831)

## Day 13 | Remove Every Kth element 
- Exactly how it sounds, remove every Kth element from the array!
- [My Solution](https://t.co/ndSLbXKBSC?amp=1)

## Day 14 | Maximum Adjacent Difference 
- Using the two adjacent elements in the array, find the pair that makes the largest difference and return the difference. Negatives don't matter.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co1674975a6bacb32e1680618)

## Day 15 | JavaScript Carousel 
- Creeate a carousel using Javascript!
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/coff9458c81274d1f36cb6a3c)

## Day 16 | Insert Dashes

- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co97a421e8bb1299d3824762d)

## Day 17 | Different Symbols Naive 
- Find all of the unique items in the array.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co31b41babe525dddfba53a50)

## Day 18 | Array Previous Less 
- Create a new array. If any of the previous elements to `i` are less than `i`, push the lower number closest in position to `i`. If there is no lower number before `i`, then push `-1`
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co3fd4e9897b3068093d6f6e8)

## Day 19 | Alphabet Subsequence 
- Is the given string in alphabetical order and does not contain any duplicates?

## Day 21 | Sum of Two
- Given two arrays and an integer, is there a combination between the two arrays where when added together, you get the given integer?
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cof574bc9b50eec7eff86f061)

## Day 22 | Extract Matrix Column
- Given an array of arrays and a column, extract the numbers in the given column into their own array.
- [My Solution](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co3ba431dbcd9971bc041115d)

## Day 23 | Social Media Input 
- Basically create a tweet creator. For JavaScriptmas, I only had to update the character count and disable the button when there are over the allowed limit. I also made the tweet button work. You can send a tweet through this app.
